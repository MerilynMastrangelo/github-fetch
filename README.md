## About the application

GitHub Fetch is a search app that uses GitHub API to retrieve user information as repository and followers details when a username is input. 

I built with Materialize framework, JavaScript (ES6), HTML & CSS. 

Through comunication with a remote server and get data from them allowed me to develop a real world data app.

API used: [https://developer.github.com/v3](https://developer.github.com/v3)
